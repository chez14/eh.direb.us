# EH, DIREBUS! (Eh, BOILED!)

I bought a rather unique domain, `direb.us` (translated: boiled). The idea is i
bought the domain and use it as link shortener but after finding so many
project, it actually didn't fit my VPS budget. I mean, why does URL shortener
takes up so many memories?

The answer ~~lies on the edge of the sky~~ is... they need to calculate the
visitor and cache the request so it doens't takes up so many disk IO.

Well then. It doesn't fit my memory budgeting, so.. i use it for my personal
stuff and lend some subdomains for my campus friends to run their project. (Like
[Semantics(.direb.us)](https://semantics.direb.us) :D).

So yeah, just for fun, I tried this approach, inspired by
[s.feid.dev](https://github.com/frontend-id/s.feid.dev). Thanks!
